<h2>Privacy Policy - 4 Pics 1 Word Answers Help</h2>
<div class="main">
<p>This privacy policy applies to the app 4 Pics 1 Word Answers Help (hereinafter referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, developed by SIRISH SHRESTHA (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider") as an ad-supported service. This service is provided "AS IS".</p><br>

<strong>What information does the Application collect and how is it used?</strong><br><strong>Information provided by the user</strong>

<p>The app does not require user accounts, and users are not required to provide personal information.</p><br>

<strong>Third-party data collection</strong>

<ul>
  <li><b>Firebase Analytics:</b> Collects anonymized device information, including app usage and events, to understand user behavior and improve functionality based on user preferences.</li>
  <li><b>Google AdMob:</b> Collects data for ad delivery, performance, and personalized ads based on user preferences.</li>
  <li><b>Expo:</b> May collect technical information to monitor app performance.</li>
<li><b>Free Dictionary API:</b> Used to fetch word meanings and definitions. This API may process requests to provide accurate data but does not collect personally identifiable information from the app.</li>
</ul>

<br><strong>User privacy preferences</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Analytics tracking:</b>  Users can enable or disable analytics tracking in the app’s privacy settings. Analytics tracking is disabled by default, and users must explicitly opt-in for Firebase Analytics to collect data from their device. When tracking is disabled, Firebase Analytics will not collect any data from the device.</li>
  <li><b>Personalized ads:</b> Users can disable personalized ads in the app’s privacy settings. When disabled, users will still see ads, but they will not be tailored to their interests, and may be less relevant. The app will continue to function normally with non-personalized ads.

</ul>

<br><strong>Does the Application collect precise real-time location information of the device?</strong>
<p>This application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p><br>

<ul>
  <li><b>Your rights as an EU citizen:</b> Users in the European Union have rights under the GDPR, including the right to access, rectify, delete, restrict, and object to the processing of personal data. Since the app does not directly collect personal data, users wishing to exercise these rights regarding third-party data should contact the app’s support team for assistance in reaching Firebase and Google AdMob.</li>
