      subject to these Terms.

    <h2>11) Termination</h2>

    <p>
      Your use of MyPlant is also governed by our Privacy Policy. Please review it carefully.

      (Tip: host your Privacy Policy at a dedicated URL like <code>/privacy.html</code> and Terms at <code>/terms.html</code>.)
    </p>

    <h2>14) Purchases and Refunds (If Added Later)</h2>
    <p>
      MyPlant is currently free. If we introduce paid features (such as subscriptions or in-app purchases) in the future,
      those purchases will generally be handled through the <strong>Apple App Store</strong> or <strong>Google Play</strong>.
      Refunds, if available, will be subject to the platform’s billing and refund policies unless otherwise required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>15) Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      MyPlant is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all
      warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
    </p>

    <h2>16) Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, MyPlant will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
      or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising from or related to
      your use of (or inability to use) the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the extent liability cannot be excluded, our total liability for any claim will be limited to the amount you paid for
      the app in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim — and since the app is currently free, this amount is
      typically <strong>zero</strong>, except where prohibited by law.
    </p>

    <h2>17) Governing Law and Disputes</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Nepal</strong>, without regard to conflict of law principles.
      Any dispute arising from these Terms or the app will be brought in the competent courts in Nepal, unless applicable law
      requires otherwise.
    </p>

    <h2>18) Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Effective Date” above and
      may provide notice in the app. Continued use of MyPlant after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
